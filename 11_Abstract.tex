The area of high speed interfaces regularly revolves around the analog and digital domain.
Analog effects have to be taken in to account in order to allow for improved high speed digital communication.
Different on-chip and off-chip techniques are covered and associated to possibly further improve the future performance of computer systems.
Nowadays, computer system designers have take a lot of bottlenecks into account.
The techniques described allow for some alleviation of these barriers.
More specifically, on-chip techniques for improving the bandwidth by using passive components like the addition of a direct
capacitor on the transceiver line and the use of a T-line are discussed.
Also the of-chip communication is covered by the implementation of global timing recovery solution.
